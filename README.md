# wordpress-child-theme-hatch-min
Wordpress child theme for the hatch theme that mainly removes clutter 


## Installation

1) On your server, copy the directory `hatch-child/` from this repo to `<your-wordpress-dir>/wp-content/themes/`. Make sure the directory and all its contents have proper access rights so your web server can read the files.

    - Check: as a result, you should now have the following file: `<your-wordpress-dir>/wp-content/themes/hatch-child/style.css` (and some more in the same location).

2) Activate the child theme in the Wordpress Admin panel (see `Appearance => Themes`).

3) You may have to re-save your menus and theme options (including background and header images) in the Wordpress Admin panel (see `Appearance => Menus`).
